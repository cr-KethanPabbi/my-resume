    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>As an analyst, I've led diverse projects, notably crafting an escalation dashboard. Leveraging Looker Studio, Google Forms, Google Sheets, and AppScripts, I developed an integrated frontend-backend system. Additionally, I seamlessly incorporated Salesforce data. While my expertise isn't cybersecurity-specific, my strength lies in cross-platform integration and rapid adaptation to new domains.</p>
